# Message for Your Co-worker

Hi! I've added comprehensive documentation to help you access this repository. Here's what you need to do:

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

1. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication** on your GitHub account:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/security
   - Enable 2FA using Microsoft Authenticator (recommended)

2. **Link your Microsoft email** to GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/emails
   - Add your @microsoft.com email and verify it

3. **Let me know** your GitHub username so I can add you as a collaborator

4. **If prompted for SSO** when accessing the repo, click "Authorize"

## Documentation Available

I've created three guides to help:

1. **[ACCESS_QUICKSTART.md](./ACCESS_QUICKSTART.md)** - Quick reference (start here!)
2. **[COLLABORATION.md](./COLLABORATION.md)** - Detailed step-by-step guide
3. **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** - How to contribute code

## What Changed?

**Answer to your question**: You don't need to change repository access levels. The issue was that we didn't have documentation for Microsoft enterprise users on how to properly set up access.

The repository is likely private or requires collaborator access. Once you:
- Enable 2FA (required by Microsoft policies)
- Link your Microsoft email
- Get added as a collaborator

You'll be able to access everything!

## Common Issues Solved

The documentation covers all common access issues:
- ✅ "Repository not found" errors
- ✅ "Permission denied" when cloning
- ✅ SSH key authorization
- ✅ Personal Access Token setup
- ✅ SSO authorization

Check the troubleshooting section in COLLABORATION.md if you run into any issues.
